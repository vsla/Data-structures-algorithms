# Data-structures-algorithms
Path to get into Big Techs

## Roadmap
- (2 months) Get the basement of Data structures and algorithms
- (3 months) Get more and more leetCode
- (1 months) Prepare for the interviews

## Get into Data structures and algorithms
Get 2 months and dive into the basement of Data structures and algorithms
### Books
**Maybe start by reviewing algorithms from the beginning with the first book, and then diving into cracking the code?**

- Entendendo Algoritmos: Um Guia Ilustrado Para Programadores e Outros Curiosos
- Cracking the code interview

### VÃ­deos
**Or, start with those videos?**
- [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Spring 2020
](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP)

## Leet Code
After getting the basement, start doing Leet Code 3x a week 2 hours

## Prepare for the interviews
- Dive into how the interviews works
    -  Questions maded by the interviews
    -  Questions that i can make
- Mock interviews
    - See online mock interviews
    - Try interviews asking for real interviews on linkedin (Or find how to conect with them)
